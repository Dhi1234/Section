                    <h3>Temple Festivals of Kerala</h3>
                    <p>Many of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year. A common
                        characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the
                        final day of the festival after immersing the deity. Other known festivals are
                        Makaravilakku, Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela Other
                        than these, festivals locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual
                        basis. When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will
                        usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it. Processions often include
                        traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.</p>
